mksd v.1.0 by 50m30n3 2011

This program allows you to download and upload patches from your Microkorg.
It can also print a rough textual description of a downloaded patch.

You can either use the legacy OSS midi devices at /dev/midi* to access
the device or the ALSA rawmidi ports at /dev/snd/midi*. Both will work fine.
